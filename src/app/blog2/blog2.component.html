          In the ever-changing world of technology, companies are always on the
          lookout to speed up processes while not compromising on the quality
          aspect that their customers expect. Automation comes to the rescue of
          tech professionals and other industries where certain processes are
          automated to make the overall system more efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the idea of automation scares many people, as automation
          itself means fewer people will be required to do certain tasks. But
          automation can be a boon if we can maintain a balance between man and
          machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the tech world, artificial intelligence and automation are
          assisting human developers at every step of the software development
          life cycle (SDLC)—from project planning to estimation to quality
          assurance and testing. Automation continues to leverage the tech
          industry.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What can be automated in Software Development?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Today the role of a software developer looks quite different than what
          it was before 10 years and it is going to look different again 10
          years down the line. However, one thing is certain—automation cannot
          replace real human developers anytime soon. Instead, automation and
          artificial intelligence is playing a big role in addressing various
          challenges faced during the software development life cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern software development processes use distributed version control
          software along with a build process run on deployment. This is a
          perfect example of where automation can fit in to expedite the
          processes while also containerizing them. Developers can obtain the
          latest version of a software product simply by accessing the version
          control software and running the build script. The same process can
          help with deployment to production environments as well with minimal
          human interaction which prevents common human errors and speeds up
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the time modern software developers use many third-party
          libraries, APIs, frameworks, microservices, etc to build their product
          and function. These things often make deployment challenging—here is
          where automation can help build a standardized environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another good area where automation can help is in the testing step of
          the development process. Tests help to maintain software integrity and
          user experience. Testing is a rather tedious and repetitive process
          for humans and can lead to burnout and errors over time. Automation
          helps run tests that quickly minimize time-to-market and increase
          chances of catching defects fast.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Areas to implement automation in the future:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Automated quality assessment – QA testing or Quality assurance testing
          is a time-consuming manual process with significant room for error.
          With automation, developers can quickly and accurately test their
          code. This improves the overall development process, allows to quickly
          fix the bugs, and shortens the development life cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Automated code quality review and optimization – AI and automation
          will go hand in hand for developers to optimize their coding
          procedures during development and produce overall better codes.
          AI-powered software automation also incorporates “autocomplete”
          practices into the development process which boosts speed and
          accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Code generation - Automation can be used to generate test codes.
          Simple code generation involves simple logic but requires a
          significant amount of data to run tests. Automation allows developers
          to automatically generate test codes via different field inputs that
          run tests quickly and in a more comprehensive way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Test avatars – Machines become "digital twins" of human testers by
          applying triggers in requirements and specifications posed by
          environments. A digital twin facilitates test-first concepts and takes
          advantage of version control systems for designing quality codebases.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Future for Automation in Development</strong></p>
        <p>
          In the future, developers will continue to leverage automation when
          there are defined repetitive tasks. Repetitive tasks often lead to
          burnout for humans. Through automation, developers can focus on more
          product and project-focused ideas to improve their job profiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking about automation, we should remember that it cannot steal
          jobs and replace humans. Automation helps individuals handle complex
          repetitive jobs that require more time and effort than they are worth
          in terms of workable hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humans still have to be involved in the development process to ensure
          the correctness of the work completed by the automated tools and help
          create the use cases of said tools. Developers may transition to more
          supervisory and project management roles but they will always have to
          tell the automated systems what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, developers should embrace the idea of incorporating automation
          into their jobs to make lives easier for them—the reason why they got
          into their careers in the first place instead of doing repetitive
          work.
