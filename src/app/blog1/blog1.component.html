          Maintenance of legacy software requires much time and resources and in
          reality, upgrading them may offer more advantages.
        </p>
        <p>
          "66% of IT professionals reported that the COVID-19 pandemic exposed
          weaknesses in their digital strategy" according to AppDynamics’ Agents
          of Transformation Report 2020: COVID-19 Special Edition. These
          technology-related issues occur because organizations keep relying on
          legacy systems.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What is a legacy system?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Legacy systems are basically outdated software and technology that
          businesses continue to use within their organizations despite many
          problems they face with them. Often, the tools become so deeply
          integrated into the structure and procedures of the organization that
          employees and leaders alike don’t even consider replacing them with
          updated models.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason why people keep using older systems is the amount of time
          and resources they have invested into maintaining those systems. Also,
          there is the fear of having to learn new and unfamiliar tools. Thus
          the systems simply seem to be irreplaceable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet these reasons shouldn’t keep one away from considering new
          software whose performance is far better than legacy systems rife with
          issues.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Problems with Legacy Systems</strong></p>
        <p><strong>1. Security</strong></p>
        <p>
          Cybercrime is on the rise. Hackers have become more sophisticated in
          their approaches, and data breaches, ransomware attacks, and
          cybersecurity problems are becoming increasingly prevalent.
        </p>
        <p>
          An organization that depends on legacy systems is at far more risk
          from hackers than companies that adapt to new technology. Outdated
          systems are more susceptible to cyber-attacks. That’s because vendors
          prefer updating and upgrading their newer models, ones that have the
          latest iterations of malware and guard against issues. However, when
          we rely on old, outdated systems, we are unlikely to receive these
          updates putting our entire business at risk.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2. Expensive Maintenance</strong></p>
        <p>
          To many business leaders, upgrading software seems to be an expensive
          and uphill task. But in reality, it is far less costly than
          maintaining an outdated system. Upkeep of legacy systems is a costly
          affair--far more expensive than it would cost to simply overhaul your
          software and hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, we can keep investing in older systems, but they will never
          reach the level of quality of newer models. Hence, we end up wasting
          money on technology that will never meet the standards we need.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Inefficiency</strong></p>
        <p>
          Workers find legacy systems slow in operation. Despite the fact that
          they have been using them for years and years, legacy systems continue
          to frustrate workers across departments.
        </p>
        <p>
          These systems are characterized by long load times, lags, and much
          more. They might have been good at their work earlier, but with time
          software slows down. And as manufacturers stop releasing updates for
          older systems, there is no way to make the systems faster and more
          efficient.
        </p>
        <p><strong>4. Incompatibility</strong></p>
        <p>
          Generally, a business uses a range of technologies, some systems are
          new and some are old. When we attempt to merge older systems with
          newer systems, a host of problems arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a difficult task to integrate older and newer systems. These
          incompatibilities force one to use more systems than they would
          otherwise since newer models offer a multitude of features that
          support a wide range of processes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>5. Data Silos</strong></p>
        <p>
          This is an incompatibility issue. When you rely on outdated systems,
          they will fail to integrate among themselves properly and we end up
          using them in isolation. This is what is called data silos, meaning
          information is isolated within specific systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a huge problem for both small and big organizations leading to
          wastage of a lot of time and energy. Employees often have to tap into
          different tools to find out what they need, while modern systems such
          as ERPs store this data in a single place.
        </p>
        <p><strong>6. Lack of Support</strong></p>
        <p>
          Usually legacy systems are no longer supported by their manufacturers
          because they are obsolete and not sold anymore. If some issue with the
          software is encountered, the vendor might not be able to troubleshoot
          it. We may like to receive support from third-party vendors, but even
          that will become more and more unlikely as the technology becomes
          outdated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The simple answer to this is—replacing our legacy systems with newer
          systems, but this seems to be more complex for most business leaders.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          We may like to create a list of priorities, considering which systems
          are causing the most trouble and could be solved with up-to-date
          technology. An expert can be engaged at this point who will suggest to
          us how to move our technology into the modern age. There are many
          qualified outsourcing firms who can assist us in this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the advantages of upgrading our legacy systems are many: lower
          costs, better security, greater efficiency, the ability to integrate
          our software, and more support. The challenges discussed may not go
          away totally— but we should take action before they do even more
          damage
