        <p>
          When it comes to the software development process, productivity is of
          paramount importance. Productivity depends on how developers can
          quickly build quality products.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are quite lucky if we have a talented team of developers who can
          build high-quality software products with high speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very difficult to build quality software quickly without a
          productive, collaborative environment. Fortunately, there are many
          ways for businesses and teams to keep their productivity and quality
          up simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Why is productivity so important?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Products tend to have a short lifespan in the technology business.
          Businesses must constantly strive to bring in new software and updates
          for existing products to stay ahead of the game and meet the needs of
          the end consumer. Businesses are going to fall behind if they don’t
          provide output at a rapid speed and ensure what they build is
          valuable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Productivity is also associated with quality. It is required to not
          only work efficiently for businesses but have processes in place to
          maintain quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ways to make your software development productive:</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Access your current position</strong></p>
        <p>
          When we think of implementing real change—that is making our processes
          more productive—we must access our current position first. Questions
          like—how does our development team spends its time, what are the
          bottlenecks faced, etc should be asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start with, we should sit with our team to evaluate their workflow,
          ask them questions regarding how they utilize their time. The same can
          be done through the distribution of anonymous surveys to get more
          clarity on the current state of productivity. The data we gather is
          very important.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we establish our goals, we can better move forward, planning for
          ways to address problems.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Make clear cut goals</strong></p>
        <p>
          To avoid confusion and chaos, we should clearly communicate our goals
          to the team as this will lead to improving productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goals have to be actionable and achievable. Vague objectives
          without proper measurement will serve nothing—we will not know when we
          have achieved them and our benchmarks will go in vain without
          improving productivity.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Take Advantage of tools Available to You</strong></p>
        <p>
          In today’s world, software are available for practically any purpose
          that we can imagine. We can use tools like time trackers which help us
          manage our time spent on projects and assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are project management platforms like Trello and Wrike which
          help to streamline projects and give us and our team insight into how
          the project is progressing.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Consider Automation</strong></p>
        <p>
          With artificial intelligence and other innovation, many manual
          processes can now be automated. Rather than replacing humans in the
          software development process, technology can handle monotonous,
          repetitive tasks and grant freedom to humans to use their talents and
          take care of more complex tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Automation is a key part of quality assurance (QA) testing.
          Professionals create tests and use automation in conjunction with
          manual testing making the overall process more efficient.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Have an outsourced team</strong></p>
        <p>
          Our in-house team might be quite talented. But when we bring in an
          outside team, it improves the overall productivity by filling in the
          gaps of our business. They can, for example, handle certain aspects of
          the project that our in-house team doesn’t have time to fulfil or can
          bring new skills into the fold.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a good option if we have a small team or missing certain
          capabilities. We can use an outsourcing partner as and when needed
          when there is a time crunch or otherwise could use an extra hand.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Measure Productivity</strong></p>
        <p>
          Productivity being a tangible entity is difficult to measure. However,
          we can evaluate our efforts in certain ways. First of all, we need to
          access our initial goal to achieve productivity. Over time we will be
          able to see if we are meeting that goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the time spent on the project, the cumulative input, and the
          output of all team members. But at the end of the day, it is not just
          about completing a project but also a matter of its quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is always good to establish metrics at the beginning to
          measure productivity. Not just the time spent, individual efforts and
          collaboration also matter.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Communicate</strong></p>
        <p>
          Communication is key to a productive environment. Each member of the
          team should constantly communicate with each other towards their
          shared end goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have to determine what channels of communication we would like to
          use. Perhaps Slack can be used for more frequent, casual check-ins,
          whereas Zoom can be used as the primary platform for large, weekly
          meetings. Also, there should be a system in place for emergencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, everyone should be kept in the loop. This is something that
          is critical for keeping both productivity and morale high.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Deliver Feedback</strong></p>
        <p>
          Team members should know if they are being productive on a given job.
          Here the feedback of a leader plays an important role. Feedback helps
          them identify areas that need improvement. It also facilitates strong
          relationship-building—a key part of making an efficient,
          high-performing team.
        </p>
        <p>
          A leader should develop ways to deliver feedback both to individuals
          and large teams. Everyone should receive feedback regularly.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
        <p>
          The above mechanisms help to bring up team productivity and morale. A
          more productive team and overall business translate to a more
          efficient, higher-performing software development process. Thus it
          leads to faster turnarounds, stronger engagement among team members,
          and better products.
