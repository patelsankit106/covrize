        <h3 class="mb-30"></h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            The technology-driven business environment is getting more dynamic
            and complex every day, making it impossible for non-technical
            businesses (individuals, SMEs, and agencies) to remain relevant. In
            such cases, it is best to outsource certain skills and activities to
            specialist or domain-specific teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it is critical for businesses to adapt, and a trusted
            partner can surely assist firms in increasing revenues by delivering
            all services under one roof while reducing overhead costs. With 50+
            years of combined experience, <b class="brand-we">WE</b> at Covrize
            are well-versed in the needs of nontechnical businesses, and WE've
            listed a few of them below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The never-ending quest to boost revenue and profit margins without
              increasing operational costs. To avoid missing out on business
              chances, provide as many services as possible under one roof.
            </li>
            <li>
              Working with a single reliable partner team rather than several
              channels or freelancers is required.
            </li>
            <li>
              To avoid missing focusing fewer chances, provide as many services
              as possible under one roof.
            </li>
            <li>The tech partner's dependability and transparency.</li>
            <li>
              Allowing specialists to handle the complexities of technology
              while focusing on core activities and business development.

          <p>
            In this arrangement, the partner can provide all of Covrize's
            services to its clients without them being aware that an offshore
            team exists. While Covrize serves as a backend partner, the partner
            communicates with the end client and handles billing and Covrize
            teams maintains the confidentiality.

          <h3 class="mb-30">Strategic Technology Partnership</h3>
          <p>
            In this model, the client hires both the partner and Covrize for the
            projects and distributes the work between them. For example, the
            project manager may be provided by the partner, while the
            development team is provided by Covrize. The client is billed
            separately by each team.

            India.

                  <p>
                    In this model, the client hires both the partner and Covrize
                    for the projects and distributes the work between them. For
                    example, the project manager may be provided by the partner,
                    while the development team is provided by Covrize. The
                    client is billed separately by each team.
