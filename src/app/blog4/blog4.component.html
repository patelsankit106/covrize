        <p>
          In the modern era, security is of paramount importance when it comes
          to developing websites, apps, and software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to visualize that you are moving into a new house. The onus of
          ensuring the highest safety standards of construction lies on the
          builder. If you saw a cracked foundation and no doors, then you will
          hold the builder accountable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, customers expect their software development companies or
          teams to make sure the code for their new project incorporates the
          strictest cybersecurity practices to protect their businesses.
          Developers need to follow secure coding standards to prevent
          vulnerabilities in the code and make it difficult for hackers to
          access sensitive data, install ransomware, and wreak havoc with cyber
          threats.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What are secure coding standards and practices?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Coding practices, decisions, and techniques used by developers during
          the software, app, and website development life cycle are known as
          secure coding standards. Their primary goal is to ensure that
          developers write and use code that helps protect both the owner of the
          software as well as its users by minimizing security vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          So there is always a scenario whether to go for speedy development
          which decreases time-to-market or to go for secure coding practices.
          Business owners are aware of this gamble and know how data breaches
          and cyberattacks happen due to less secure codes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Secure coding guidelines</strong></p>
        <p>
          The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has produced a set
          of guidelines or “best practices” for secure coding in the modern
          world in response to the enormous amount of cyberattacks and new
          developing methods for such attacks. These guidelines help developers
          keep the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as secure as possible
          and keep threats at bay once they move into production.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Top practices for secure coding:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Password Management</strong> - Passwords are something that
          hackers can always play with and serve as a weak access point. A weak
          password takes a very short time to crack compared to a strong
          password but a strong password can still be cracked. Companies have
          realized this fact in the last few years and thus are engaging in
          multifactor or two-factor authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Companies must ensure that developers use the best practices for
          choosing passwords in terms of complexity and adequate length in order
          to withstand cyberattacks. This means choosing the most secure
          passwords for use in their products, disabling password entry after
          multiple incorrect attempts, and never storing plain-text passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Security by Design</strong> - The "security by design"
          approach makes security the top priority during the development of
          code. Companies who choose other priorities such as optimizing for
          development speed instead of security, often pay for it later on due
          to data breaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Security by design approach reduces the future cost of technical debt
          while also mitigating risks before they happen. Throughout SDLC,
          developers should perform source code analysis and implement security
          automation wherever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Access Control</strong> – Through the denial of sensitive
          data, we can avoid future data leaks. This access control mechanism
          includes restricting access to sensitive data to only those who truly
          need it and even limiting their privileges. Also, developers shouldn’t
          consider hierarchy in dictating data access as managers often have the
          least technical training but the most access, which is dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Validate Data Input</strong> – Developers must ensure that
          their forms collect only the accepted data formats in the form fields
          and validate all input fields for length, range, character sets,
          expected data types, and character encoding. Prevention of blacklisted
          characters such as parentheses and special characters helps prevent
          hackers from finding a way into the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers can handle this in different ways. This includes encoding
          data to ensure proper handling of special characters, using regular
          expressions to ensure that data uses the expected character, and
          parameterizing database queries to avoid theft, wiping, or modifying
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >System Configuration, Patching, and Vulnerability
            Management</strong
          >
          – While this aspect is not exactly a “development” aspect of software
          and app development, every team member of the development team should
          clear their systems of any unnecessary components. They should also
          take time to update their tools, software, and platforms with the
          latest versions and patches. Outdated software is more vulnerable for
          hackers to get inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, development teams should also release patches and
          versions for the software they develop. This helps protect the
          integrity and reputation of the business and also the end users’
          private data. Secure coding practices involve creating and releasing
          regular updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The above may not be a complete list of secure coding best practices,
          but they are important for companies to keep falling prey to hackers
          and cyber threats. Adherence to them in addition to the full list of
          OWASP recommendations, helps development teams have the right tools
          for protecting their code, end users’ information, and their company.
