        <h2 class="mb-20">Say goodbye to ODC challenges with Covrize</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-30"></h3>
        <div class="mb-60">
          <p>
            A common phenomenon among tech consulting companies, service
            providers, agencies, and so on is to venture into IT outsourcing as
            a strategy to save on costs. The challenge is finding a reliable,
            adaptable, and flexible outsourcing partner that fits pre-existing
            processes without overlapping them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In such cases, a possible solution is to adopt a Build, Operate,
            Transfer (BOT) model in software outsourcing. WE, at Covrize, enable
            our partners to manage and build an outsourced unit.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a service provider to an organization,
            <b class="brand-we">WE</b> help set up, optimize, and run an IT or
            business process service delivery operation to transfer the
            operation to the organization as a captive center. As soon as the
            organization is ready to take over and fully operate the entire
            operation being managed by us, <b class="brand-we">WE</b> hand over
            the same to them any time after they have made the decision. When
            the time comes, the entire operation under us is transferred from us
            to the owner company.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a BOT to happen, an organization has to undertake a contract
            with us as an outsourcing partner to help build shared services or
            offshore delivery centers that it can operate for a set period.
            After the team is fully adapted to the company’s methodologies,
            processes, and tools, it can take full control of the team. By this
            companies can mitigate the risk associated with the start-up stage
            and strengthen their capabilities slowly in a foreign country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our BOT model enables companies to scale up capabilities fast and
            deliver value from day one. <b class="brand-we">WE</b> work shoulder
            to shoulder with your teams towards your end goals and operate at
            maximum efficiency—to transfer capabilities back to you so that you
            can thrive independently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Covrize’s BOT consulting team will help your company develop the
            capabilities needed to control your growth trajectory. Please find
            the below checklist to help identify whether the
            Build-Operate-Transfer concept is right for your organization.
